# SDI-Project-1
You will be using what you have learned over the past weeks to make a fully functional web application.

API: https://metmuseum.github.io/
Trello: https://trello.com/b/LBWoN1lJ/sdi-project-1

My application will be based on this https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection 
    It will be my own version of searching through the art studio.


By completing this project, you will demonstrate that you are able to:

Build a static webpage
Layout a well-designed static webpage using HTML & CSS
Make fetch requests to hydrate a static page with data
Create interactivity using object-oriented JavaScript
Project Instructions
For this project you should fork and clone the Project 1 scaffold repo

You will choose from a list of the approved third party APIs shown in the Curated API List lesson in this unit. Your application must request some data from the API and present it in a human-readable and aesthetically pleasing format. How you decide to present this data and the functionality of the page is mostly up to you, but should follow the following guidelines

Base Requirements
Should utilize user stories and kanban board for planning process
Identify the functionality and features for what you are attempting to achieve, what should be rendered to your page, what will the user see when they navigate to your page.
Should present data from API in a human-readable format utilizing fetch and promises
Should present data from API in an aesthetically pleasing format using semantic HTML and CSS
Should have event handlers for user interaction
Should contain a README with instructions to new users on how to set up and run the application
How to download the project
How to run the project
Any other directions needed to use your application
Where should the user navigate to in their browser
-----Bonus Content-----
Should utilize classes that use private properties when applicable
Utilize Postman to test APIs
Expand the functionality of your page to provide additional details/games/supporting content.
Should have more than three features (sorting/searching/shuffling/details pages/etc...)
Implement a Loading Spinner for slow API calls
Stretch Goals
Write a unit test for your existing functions so that you can test edge cases, i.e: what happens if null is passed into your function, what happens if the API isn't working, etc.
Should gracefully handle any errors while sending HTTP requests
Should pass all tests in its test suite(s)

















------------------------------TIPS AND CHECKLIST: ----------------------------------
1. Planning Phase
 Create User Stories: Define key user stories that describe how the user will interact with your app. For example:
"As a user, I want to see a list of products so that I can choose one to learn more about."
"As a user, I want to sort the products by price so that I can find the most affordable one."
 Set Up a Kanban Board: Use tools like Trello, Jira, or GitHub Projects to organize tasks. Create columns such as:
Backlog
In Progress
Testing
Done
2. Define Features and Functionality
 Identify the API: Choose an API from the Curated API List.
 List Functionality: Define what the user will see and interact with. Examples:
A list of items fetched from the API.
A detailed view of an item when clicked.
Search or filter options.
 Break Features into Tasks:
Fetch data from API.
Display data in a human-readable format.
Create event handlers for interactions (e.g., clicking on an item for details).
Implement sorting/filtering functions.
Display error or loading states (loading spinner for slow API calls).
3. Development Phase
 Set Up Project: Initialize a project repository on GitHub.
 README File: Begin drafting the README with instructions for setting up and running the project (you can complete this as you go).
 Fetch API Data: Use fetch and promises to retrieve data from the API.
Test your API calls using Postman.
 Create Classes (if applicable): Use classes to structure your code, implementing private properties when needed.
 Build User Interface:
Use semantic HTML for structuring content.
Add CSS to make the design aesthetically pleasing.
 Add Event Handlers:
Attach events for user interactions (e.g., clicks, hovers, searches).
Ensure user input or interaction is handled appropriately (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).
 Add Loading Spinner: Implement a loading spinner to show when API calls are slow.
4. Bonus Features
 Add Additional Functionality:
Consider adding sorting, searching, or filtering.
Add additional pages or games for the user to interact with, such as a detail page or dynamic features (e.g., shuffle).
5. Testing Phase
 Test the Functionality:
Test all user interactions like button clicks, data fetching, and sorting/filtering.
Ensure the loading spinner appears for slow API calls.
 Test in Multiple Browsers: Make sure the app works across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
6. Create Documentation
 Complete README File: Include clear instructions for setting up and running the project.
How to clone/download the project.
How to install dependencies and run it locally.
Where to navigate to access the app in the browser.
 API Usage: Add notes on API usage, and any limitations or API keys required.
7. Deployment (Optional)
 Deploy Application: Deploy the application on a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Heroku for easy access by users.
8. Final Checks
 Review User Stories: Ensure all user stories are completed.
 Perform Cross-Check: Review requirements and confirm each has been addressed, especially:
Semantic HTML
CSS for aesthetics
User event handlers
README documentation
 Submit Your Project: Submit your project according to the assignment guidelines.
