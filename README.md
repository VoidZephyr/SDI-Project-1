# SDI-Project-1
You will be using what you have learned over the past weeks to make a fully functional web application.

API: https://metmuseum.github.io/
Trello: https://trello.com/b/LBWoN1lJ/sdi-project-1

By completing this project, you will demonstrate that you are able to:

Build a static webpage
Layout a well-designed static webpage using HTML & CSS
Make fetch requests to hydrate a static page with data
Create interactivity using object-oriented JavaScript
Project Instructions
For this project you should fork and clone the Project 1 scaffold repo

You will choose from a list of the approved third party APIs shown in the Curated API List lesson in this unit. Your application must request some data from the API and present it in a human-readable and aesthetically pleasing format. How you decide to present this data and the functionality of the page is mostly up to you, but should follow the following guidelines

Base Requirements
Should utilize user stories and kanban board for planning process
Identify the functionality and features for what you are attempting to achieve, what should be rendered to your page, what will the user see when they navigate to your page.
Should present data from API in a human-readable format utilizing fetch and promises
Should present data from API in an aesthetically pleasing format using semantic HTML and CSS
Should have event handlers for user interaction
Should contain a README with instructions to new users on how to set up and run the application
How to download the project
How to run the project
Any other directions needed to use your application
Where should the user navigate to in their browser
Bonus Content
Should utilize classes that use private properties when applicable
Utilize Postman to test APIs
Expand the functionality of your page to provide additional details/games/supporting content.
Should have more than three features (sorting/searching/shuffling/details pages/etc...)
Implement a Loading Spinner for slow API calls
Stretch Goals
Write a unit test for your existing functions so that you can test edge cases, i.e: what happens if null is passed into your function, what happens if the API isn't working, etc.
Should gracefully handle any errors while sending HTTP requests
Should pass all tests in its test suite(s)
